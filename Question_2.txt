2) Saraighat Bridge is the only bridge that connects the scenic north and south Guwahati and plays a vital role as it is one of the busiest bridges in the region. The bridge can become deadlocked if northbound and southbound people get on the bridge at the same time. (Let us assume the people are stubborn and are unable to back up.) Write a C /C++ code to implement the scenario of bridge using semaphores and/or mutex locks, that prevents deadlock.
➢ Case 1 : Consider the scenario in which northbound people prevent southbound people from using the bridge, or vice versa.
➢ Case 2 : Consider the scenario in which northbound people don't prevent southbound people from using the bridge, or vice versa.
Represent northbound and southbound people as separate threads. Once a person is on the bridge, the associated thread will sleep for a random period of time, representing travelling across the bridge. Design your program so that you can create several threads representing the northbound and southbound persons.
